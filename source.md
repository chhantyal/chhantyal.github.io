Welcome to my website. 

I am **Nar Kumar Chhantyal**. Thatâ€™s rather a long name, feel free to pick one from first two ðŸ˜„
I am originally from Nepal. Few years back, I moved to Berlin, Germany for work (and then to Stuttgart). 
Before that, I studied and worked in India for five years.

Professionally, I am Software Developer/Data Engineer, thus know a thing or two about computers and internet ðŸ™‚
I am interested in web services, big data, distributed systems and good UX.

Apart from building things on/for the internet, I like reading books, running/cycling, traveling and trying to do things cool kids do ðŸ˜œ

Anyways, if you would like to stay in touch â€“ we can do social network thing (links to my profiles are below).
You can also write to me at noblenara [at] gmail.com

### Projects

- [Python 3 Readiness] - a site which tracks Python 3 adoption. It became quite populer that Python creator [van Rossum] shared on Twitter :)
It was even on [Hacker News] front page.

- [Code Syntax Highlighter] - Confluence plugin for better code syntax highlighting.
If you use Confluence for documentation and don't like default code macro, give it a try.

- [Jupyter/IPython Notebook Viewer] - add-on which renders Jupyter/IPython notebooks in Confluence pages.

All other open source projects are on Github, including source for [this website].
