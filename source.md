Welcome to my website. 

I am **Nar Kumar Chhantyal**. Thatâ€™s rather a long name to remember, feel free to pick one from first two ðŸ˜‰

I am originally from Nepal. Few years back, I moved to Berlin, Germany for work (and then to Stuttgart). 
Before that, I studied and worked in India for half a decade.

Professionally, I am Software Developer/Data Engineer, thus know a thing or two about computers and internet ðŸ™‚
I am interested in web services, big data, distributed systems and good UX.

Apart from building things on/for the internet, I have wide range of other interests.
Some of them are reading, running/cycling, traveling and trying to do things cool kids do ðŸ˜œ

Anyways, if you would like to stay in touch â€“ we can do social network thing (links to my profiles are below).
You can also write to me at noblenara [at] gmail.com

### Projects

- [Python 3 Readiness] - a site which tracks Python 3 adoption. It became quite populer that Python creator [van Rossum] shared on Twitter :)
It was even on [Hacker News] front page.

All other open source projects are on Github.
